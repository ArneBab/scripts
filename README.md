# Freenet Utility Scripts

See `freenetrc-sample` for script configuration.

Anything which is useful for the development of freenet, which isn't an app, a plugin, or part of Freenet itself.

Obviously the actual private keys etc won't be included...

Note that some of these scripts are supposed to run as different users:

- Most stuff involved in releasing a build is on one user.
- Some of it is on a different user.
- grabbackup is on a third user (which is just used for backups).

You will also need ssh access to osprey.
